# Hummingbot Gateway

## Introduction

Hummingbot Gateway is an API/CLI client that exposes standardized REST endponts to perform actions and fetch data from **blockchain networks** (wallet, node & chain interaction) and their **decentralized exchanges (DEX)** (pricing, trading & liquidity provision).

### API Overview

- GET /chains - List all available blockchain networks and their supported networks
- GET /connectors - List all available DEX connectors and their supported networks
- GET /ethereum/... - Ethereum chain endpoints (balances, tokens, allowances)
- GET /solana/... - Solana chain endpoints (balances, tokens)
- GET /jupiter/... - Jupiter Aggregator swap endpoints
- GET /uniswap/... - Uniswap swap, AMM, and CLMM endpoints
- GET /uniswap/routes/quote-swap - Get price quote using Uniswap V3 Swap Router (recommended for token swapping)
- GET /uniswap/routes/execute-swap - Execute swap using Uniswap V3 Swap Router (recommended for token swapping)
- GET /raydium/amm/... - Raydium AMM endpoints
- GET /raydium/clmm/... - Raydium CLMM endpoints
- GET /meteora/clmm/... - Meteora CLMM endpoints

Gateway is written in Typescript in order to use Javascript-based SDKs provided by blockchains and DEX protocols. The advantage of using Gateway is it provides a standardized, language-agnostic approach to interacting with these protocols.

Gateway may be used alongside the main [Hummingbot client](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) to enable trading and market making on DEXs, or as a standalone command line interface (CLI).

Gateway uses [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation. When Gateway is started in HTTP mode, it automatically generates interactive Swagger API docs at: <http://localhost:15888/docs>


## Installation from Source

### Install NodeJS 20+

We recommend downloading the graphical installer from the [NodeJS official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

For terminal-based users, follow the steps below to install from a Linux-based machine (Ubunbu 20+)

```bash
#  Ensure your package list is up to date and install curl
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl

# Add Node 20.x repository
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -


# Install the default versions from Ubuntuâ€™s repository:
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Check Node.js version: 
nodejs --version
```  

### Install `pnpm` package manager

`pnpm` is a faster and more space-efficient package manager than `npm`.

```bash
# Install PNPM globally
sudo npm install -g pnpm

# Check pnpm version
pnpm --version
```

### Clone Gateway repo

```bash
# Clone Github repo
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway.git

# Go to newly created folder
cd gateway

# Switch to main branch (or a specific version branch like core-2.6)
git checkout main
```

### Setup Gateway
```bash
# Install JS libraries
pnpm install

# Complile Typescript into JS
pnpm build

# Run Gateway setup script, which helps you set configs and CERTS_PATH
pnpm run setup
```

### Start Gateway

You can run Gateway in the Gateway server in unencrypted HTTP mode using the `--dev` flag. Note that a passphrase is still needed to encrypt and decrypt wallets used in executing transactions.

```bash
pnpm start --passphrase=<PASSPHRASE> --dev
```

To start the Gateway server in HTTPS mode, run the command without the `--dev` flag. Make sure to use the same passphrase that you used to generate certs in the Hummingbot client.

```bash
pnpm start --passphrase=<PASSPHRASE>
```

## Installation with Docker

Build the Gateway Docker image locally by executing the below command. You may replace `development` with a tag of your choice.

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) \
  --build-arg COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d") \
  -t hummingbot/gateway:development -f Dockerfile .
```

### Start Gateway from Docker

Start a container in HTTPS mode using this `development` Docker image. Make sure to replace `<PASSPHRASE>` with the passphrase you used to generate the certs in the Hummingbot client. 

```bash
docker run --name gateway \
  -p 15888:15888 \
  -v "$(pwd)/conf:/home/gateway/conf" \
  -v "$(pwd)/logs:/home/gateway/logs" \
  -v "$(pwd)/db:/home/gateway/db" \
  -v "$(pwd)/certs:/home/gateway/certs" \
  -e GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=<PASSPHRASE> \
  hummingbot/gateway:development
```
Afterwards, clients with valid certificates can connect to Gateway at: <https://localhost:15888>

You may also start the container in HTTP mode by setting the `DEV` environment variable to `true`. Note that this will disable HTTPS and allow unauthenticated access to Gateway and its endpoints.

```bash
docker run --name gateway \
  -p 15888:15888 \
  -v "$(pwd)/conf:/home/gateway/conf" \
  -v "$(pwd)/logs:/home/gateway/logs" \
  -v "$(pwd)/db:/home/gateway/db" \
  -v "$(pwd)/certs:/home/gateway/certs" \
  -e DEV=true \
  hummingbot/gateway:development
```

Afterwards, client may connect to Gateway at: <http://localhost:15888> and you can access the Swagger documentation UI at: <http://localhost:15888/docs>


## CLI Commands

When running Gateway from source, it provides a CLI interface for interacting with chains and DEXs. After installing from source, you can enable the `gateway` command by linking the CLI globally:
```bash
pnpm link --global
```

Afterwards, you can use the `gateway` command to see available commands:
```bash
gateway
```

Sample commands:
```bash
# Check wallet balances (requires running server)
gateway balance --chain solana --wallet <WALLET_ADDRESS>

# Build project from source (same as pnpm build)
gateway build

# Start the API server (same as pnpm start)
gateway start --passphrase=<PASSPHRASE> [--dev]

# Get command help
gateway help [COMMAND]
```

**Note:** Similar to the server, CLI commands require a `passphrase` argument used to encrypt and decrypt wallets used in executing transactions. Set the passphrase using the `--passphrase` argument when starting the server or by setting the `GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE` environment variable:
```bash
export GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=<PASSPHRASE>
```

## Contribution

Gateway is part of the open source Hummingbot project, which is powered by community contributions. Please see the [Contributing](https://hummingbot.org/gateway/contributing/) guide in the Hummingbot docs for more information.

Here are some ways that you can contribute to Gateway:

- File an issue at [hummingbot issues](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/issues)
- Make a [pull request](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/)
- Edit the [docs](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-site/)
- Vote in quarterly [polls](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth) to decide which DEXs Gateway should support

## Configuration

- To run in HTTP mode (for development), use `pnpm start --dev`. By default, Gateway runs in secure HTTPS mode.

- If you want Gateway to log to standard out, set `logToStdOut` to `true` in [conf/server.yml](./conf/server.yml).

- The format of configuration files are dictated by [src/services/config-manager-v2.ts](./src/services/config-manager-v2.ts) and the corresponding schema files in [src/templates/json](./src/templates/json).

- For each supported chain, token lists that translate address to symbols for each chain are stored in `/conf/lists`. You can add tokens here to make them available to Gateway.

## Adding a New Chain or Connector

### Adding a New Chain

1. Create chain implementation files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/chains/yourchain/routes
   touch src/chains/yourchain/yourchain.ts
   touch src/chains/yourchain/yourchain.config.ts
   touch src/chains/yourchain/yourchain.routes.ts
   touch src/chains/yourchain/yourchain.utils.ts
   ```

2. Create test mock files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p test/mocks/chains/yourchain
   touch test/mocks/chains/yourchain/balance.json
   touch test/mocks/chains/yourchain/status.json
   touch test/mocks/chains/yourchain/tokens.json
   ```

3. Create chain test file:
   ```bash
   touch test/chains/yourchain.test.js
   ```

### Adding a New Connector

1. Create connector implementation files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/connectors/yourconnector/routes
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/yourconnector.ts
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/yourconnector.config.ts
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/yourconnector.routes.ts
   ```

2. If the connector supports AMM, create these files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/connectors/yourconnector/amm-routes
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/amm-routes/executeSwap.ts
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/amm-routes/poolInfo.ts
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/amm-routes/quoteSwap.ts
   # Add other AMM operation files as needed
   ```

3. If the connector supports CLMM, create these files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/connectors/yourconnector/clmm-routes
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/clmm-routes/executeSwap.ts
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/clmm-routes/poolInfo.ts
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/clmm-routes/quoteSwap.ts
   touch src/connectors/yourconnector/clmm-routes/openPosition.ts
   # Add other CLMM operation files as needed
   ```

4. Create test mock files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p test/mocks/connectors/yourconnector
   touch test/mocks/connectors/yourconnector/amm-pool-info.json
   touch test/mocks/connectors/yourconnector/amm-quote-swap.json
   touch test/mocks/connectors/yourconnector/clmm-pool-info.json
   touch test/mocks/connectors/yourconnector/clmm-quote-swap.json
   # Add other mock response files as needed
   ```

5. Create connector test files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p test/connectors/yourconnector
   touch test/connectors/yourconnector/amm.test.js
   touch test/connectors/yourconnector/clmm.test.js
   touch test/connectors/yourconnector/swap.test.js
   ```

## Linting and Formatting

This repo uses `eslint` and `prettier` for code quality and consistent formatting.

Run linting manually with:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Format code with prettier:

```bash
pnpm format
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fixing bigint-buffer warnings

If you see warnings like `bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)` when running Gateway, you can safely ignore them. The warnings are related to the bigint-buffer package, which falls back to pure JavaScript implementation when native bindings are not available. This doesn't affect Gateway's functionality.

If you want to attempt to fix these warnings, you can run:

```bash
pnpm rebuild-bigint
```

Note that this requires having the necessary C++ build tools installed on your system.
