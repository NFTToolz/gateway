# PR #1: Core SDK Structure & Raydium AddLiquidity Extraction

## Summary

This PR establishes the foundation for the Protocol SDK by extracting Raydium's `addLiquidity` operation from Gateway's route handlers into pure SDK functionality. This proves the dual SDK/API pattern works and sets the template for all future extractions.

## What Changed

### 1. Core SDK Structure Created âœ…

**New Files**:
- `packages/sdk/src/solana/raydium/connector.ts` - RaydiumConnector implementing Protocol interface
- `packages/sdk/src/solana/raydium/add-liquidity-operation.ts` - AddLiquidityOperation implementing OperationBuilder
- `packages/sdk/src/solana/raydium/index.ts` - Raydium SDK exports
- `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` - Main SDK export

**What It Does**:
- Implements the Protocol interface for Raydium
- Extracts business logic from HTTP handlers
- Provides programmatic SDK access to operations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API

### 2. AddLiquidity Operation Extracted âœ…

**From**: 286-line route handler with mixed concerns
**To**:
- 400-line operation class with pure business logic
- 80-line API wrapper (thin HTTP layer)

**Operation Methods**:
- `validate(params)` - Validates parameters before execution
- `simulate(params)` - Simulates transaction and returns expected outcome
- `build(params)` - Builds unsigned transaction
- `execute(params)` - Signs and submits transaction (optional)

### 3. Dual Mode Demonstrated âœ…

**SDK Mode** (Direct programmatic access):
```typescript
import { RaydiumConnector } from '@nfttools/protocol-sdk';

const raydium = await RaydiumConnector.getInstance('mainnet-beta');
const tx = await raydium.operations.addLiquidity.build({
  poolAddress: '...',
  walletAddress: '...',
  baseTokenAmount: 100,
  quoteTokenAmount: 200,
});
// Use tx.raw to sign and submit manually
```

**API Mode** (HTTP REST endpoint):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:15888/connectors/raydium/amm/add-liquidity-sdk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"poolAddress": "...", "baseTokenAmount": 100, ...}'
```

Both modes use the **same business logic**!

### 4. Example Created âœ…

**File**: `examples/sdk-usage/raydium-add-liquidity.ts`

Demonstrates:
- SDK initialization
- Parameter validation
- Transaction simulation
- Transaction building
- Progressive enhancement (validate â†’ simulate â†’ build â†’ execute)
- Comparison of SDK vs API modes

## Architecture Validation

This PR proves the architecture works as designed:

âœ… **Protocol Interface**: RaydiumConnector implements Protocol cleanly
âœ… **OperationBuilder Pattern**: AddLiquidity follows the 4-step pattern
âœ… **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from HTTP handling
âœ… **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type checking
âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Existing API continues working

8. `docs/PR_1_PROGRESS.md` (updated)

### Modified (0 files)
- No existing files modified (backward compatible!)

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This PR is 100% backward compatible.

- Existing `addLiquidity.ts` route handler unchanged
- New SDK route at `/add-liquidity-sdk` for testing
- SDK can be used independently without affecting API
- Future PRs will gradually replace old route handlers

## Testing

### Manual Testing Completed âœ…

**SDK Mode**:
- [x] RaydiumConnector.getInstance() works
- [x] AddLiquidityOperation.validate() works
- [x] AddLiquidityOperation.simulate() works
- [x] AddLiquidityOperation.build() works

**API Mode**:
- [x] New `/add-liquidity-sdk` endpoint created
- [x] Calls SDK internally
- [x] Returns same response format

### Automated Tests

**Status**: To be added in follow-up

**Planned Tests**:
- Unit tests for AddLiquidityOperation
- Integration tests for SDK mode
- Integration tests for API mode
- Comparison tests (old vs new)

## Documentation

### Created
- [x] SDK usage example with 3 scenarios
- [x] Inline code documentation
- [x] PR progress report

### Updated
- [x] PR #1 progress document (marked complete)
- [x] Session summary

## Performance Impact

**Improved**:
- Business logic can now be used without HTTP overhead
- Operations can be composed programmatically
- Better code reuse

**No Degradation**:
- API mode has same performance (calls SDK, which has same logic)
- No additional dependencies added
- No breaking changes

## Migration Path

### Phase 1 (This PR)
âœ… SDK structure created
âœ… One operation extracted (addLiquidity)
âœ… Pattern proven to work

### Phase 2 (PR #2)
- Extract all Raydium AMM operations
- Extract all Raydium CLMM operations
- Replace old route handlers

### Phase 3 (PR #3)
- Apply pattern to all existing connectors
- Complete Gateway â†’ SDK migration

## Dependencies

### Temporary
- `getQuote()` temporarily imports from existing `quoteLiquidity.ts`
- Will be extracted as proper operation in PR #2

### Permanent
- Uses existing Raydium and Solana Gateway classes
- These provide blockchain connectivity
- Will be further refactored in future phases

## Success Criteria

- [x] RaydiumConnector implements Protocol interface
- [x] AddLiquidityOperation implements OperationBuilder interface
- [x] SDK mode works (programmatic access)
- [x] API mode works (HTTP endpoint)
- [x] Both modes use same business logic
- [x] Example demonstrates usage
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] No breaking changes

## Next Steps

### Immediate (PR #2)
1. Extract remaining Raydium operations:
   - removeLiquidity
   - swap
   - quoteLiquidity
   - executeSwap
   - poolInfo
   - positionInfo

2. Extract Raydium CLMM operations:
   - openPosition
   - closePosition
   - addLiquidity (CLMM version)
   - removeLiquidity (CLMM version)
   - collectFees

3. Replace old route handlers with SDK calls

### Future (PR #3)
- Apply pattern to Meteora, Jupiter, Uniswap, etc.
- Complete Phase 1 (SDK Extraction)

3. Are there any concerns about the temporary quoteLiquidity import?
4. Should we add automated tests in this PR or the next one?
5. Any suggestions for improving the SDK API?
